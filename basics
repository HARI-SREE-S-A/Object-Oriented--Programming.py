## classes

A class is a code template for creating objects. Objects have member variables and have behaviour associated with them. In python a class is created by the keyword class.

An object is created using the constructor of the class. This object will then be called the instance of the class. In Python we create instances in the following manner

Instance = class(arguments)


How to create a class
The simplest class can be created using the class keyword. For example, let's create a simple, empty class with no functionalities.

>>> class Snake:
...     pass
... 
>>> snake = Snake()
>>> print(snake)
<__main__.Snake object at 0x7f315c573550>
